This repo contains commonly used code to extend or modify **Bootstrap 5**. Anybody can use this, but I wrote it for myself. 

Visit https://ngblaylock.github.io/bootstrap-extensions/ for documentation.

While Bootstrap Extensions is in v0.x.x, I will do my best to not make breaking changes, but there is no grantee. Make sure to install only specific versions to avoid breaking changes to your websites. 

I will not be making extensions for Bootstrap 4 or earlier since I no longer use those versions. When Bootstrap 6 comes out and I feel like making extensions for it I will create a major release (v2.0.0) to handle that.
