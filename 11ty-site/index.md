This repository was created to implement modifications that apply to most, if not all, Bootstrap projects. It serves as a general-purpose tool, allowing users to pull in changes as needed. If the implementation doesnâ€™t suit specific needs, the source code can be copied into individual projects and modified accordingly.

This project supports [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/).
