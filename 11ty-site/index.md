This repository was created to implement modifications that apply to most, if not all, Bootstrap projects. It serves as a general-purpose tool, allowing users to pull in changes as needed. If the implementation doesnâ€™t suit specific needs, the source code can be copied into individual projects and modified accordingly.

This project supports [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/).

<div class="alert alert-warning">Although no breaking changes are expected in <code>v0.x.x</code>, there is no guarantee. Make sure to install only specific versions to avoid breaking changes to your websites.</div>
